# GO Enrichment Tool

This GO Term Enrichment Tool is a Python-based project that takes in a ranked list of genes and performs Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis. It calculates the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) score, p-value, signed log p-value, and False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted p-value for each GO group, helping researchers identify overrepresented biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components associated with their gene list.
